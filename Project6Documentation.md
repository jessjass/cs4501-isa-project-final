# Project 6 Write Up
## Getting Started

#### To load up our Docker application, run:
```
./before_script.sh
```
This will:

* Load up the mysql container (10 sec delay before connecting)
* Load up the mysql-cmdline container (10 sec delay before connecting)
  - Create database and add necessary users/permissions
* Load up remaining containers, including:
  - __models__: django container that connects to mysql container to serve exp layer
  - __exp__: django container that connects to models container to serve web layer
  - __web__: django container that connects to exp layer to serve lb
  - __web2__: django container that connects to exp layer to serve lb
  - __es__: elastic search container to serve search functionality
  - __kafka__: kafka container to provide queueing service
  - __batch__: python container that listens for kafka listings and serves es, also contains haproxy config
  - __lb__: haproxy container for load balancing, users connect through lb
  - __selenium-chrome__: remote chrome driver for running selenium tests
  - __selenium__: python container for running selenium end-to-end tests
  - __jmeter__: jmeter container for running performance tests

#### To clean up our Docker application (when you're done), run:
 ```
 ./after_script.sh
 ```
This will:
* Decompose the Docker containers
* Remove the existing database directory

## Load Balancing with HAProxy
HAProxy was used in order to set up a load balancer between 2 web containers. To create the load balancer, a new container called "lb" was created and mounted on top of the batch directory. This directory contained the haproxy.cfg file which defined the properties of the load balancer. It currently uses a round-robin algorithm to load balance requests between two different web containers. In order to make sure this was working we also set up papertrail account in order to see requests. As we can see below, each requests switches between web1 and web2.

## Continuous Integration with Travis

Travis Badge: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/johnmourad/cs4501-isa-project-final.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/johnmourad/cs4501-isa-project-final)

Implementing continuous integration with Travis required building up the mysql containers in the docker-compose. As part of the before_script section, Travis builds up the application by creating a db directory, building the mysql and mysql-cmdline containers, and then composing the remaining containers. 

The main script runs the unit tests in the models container and E2E tests in the selenium container. 

There were lots of challenges getting Travis CI up and running due to setting the up the db containers, escaping special characters like '$', and setting up the correct user permissions. It was pretty cool to see the green light once it started working!

## E2E Testing with Selenium

### Integrating Selenium E2E Tests with Travis CI
We wrote end-to-end tests using Selenium and integrated them into Travis CI by setting up a standalone Chrome remote driver (selenium-chrome), using one of Selenium's available docker containers. You can find more information [here.](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium)

Docker containers:
```
selenium-chrome:
  image: selenium/standalone-chrome
  container_name: selenium-chrome
  links:
    - lb:lb
  ports:
    - "4444:4444"

selenium:
  image: tp33/django
  container_name: selenium
  links:
    - lb:lb
    - selenium-chrome:selenium-chrome
  volumes:
    - ./app/selenium:/app
  command: bash -c "pip install selenium==2.48 && python docker_sel_test.py"
```

Here is the set up function in docker_sel_test.py:
```
def setUp(self):
    self.driver = webdriver.Remote(
        command_executor='http://selenium-chrome:4444/wd/hub/',
        desired_capabilities=DesiredCapabilities.CHROME
    ) 
    self.driver.implicitly_wait(30)
    self.driver.maximize_window()
    self.driver.get("http://lb")
```
__References:__ I used [this](http://underthehood.meltwater.com/blog/2016/11/09/using-docker-with-selenium-server-to-run-your-browser-tests/) as a reference where a selenium remote driver is implemented for executing E2E tests written in Ruby. It was pretty helpful in figuring out how to integrate E2E tests with Travis CI.

## Performance Testing with JMeter
We decided to implement performance testing with JMeter to see how fast our application would scale, both on the DigitalOcean and running locally. 
### Test case overview
Go to the jmeter directory and with JMeter installed, you can open up the test file with the JMeter GUI via:
```
jmeter -t local-perf-test.jmx
```
* Users Config & Events Config
  - I created two config csv files for Users and Events that contain the form-data needed for logging in a user and creating an event.
* HTTP Cookie Manager
  - Allows for sessions to persist throughout performance test
* HTTP Request Defaults
  - Sets up base url for all HTTP requests (localhost:8000 for local test and lb:80 for docker tests)
* Various HTTP Request Samplers
  - These were used to set up a user's interaction (end-to-end) in the JMeter tests. 
  - First, we test the performance of accessing the home page and sign-in page.
  - Then, we sign the user in once during each iteration.
  - After, we perform various actions on the site, like accessing user dashboard, creating an event, and searching.
  - Finally, we log the user out once during each iteration.

### To run the tests with application running locally and generate reports
```
./run_local_perf.sh
```
Example output from running local jmeter tests:
```
summary +     34 in 00:00:12 =    2.8/s Avg:   120 Min:    17 Max:   329 Err:     0 (0.00%) Active: 1 Started: 4 Finished: 3
summary +     21 in 00:00:05 =    3.8/s Avg:   136 Min:    19 Max:   330 Err:     0 (0.00%) Active: 0 Started: 5 Finished: 5
summary =     55 in 00:00:18 =    3.1/s Avg:   126 Min:    17 Max:   330 Err:     0 (0.00%)

```
You can view results of the local perf test as a csv in local-perf-results-summary.csv or view the web interface by:
```
cd local-perf-results
open index.html
```
When you're done viewing the results, be sure to clean before running another test locally (clean_local_perf.sh is in app/jmeter).
```
./clean_local_perf.sh
```
### To run the tests on app hosted on DigitalOcean
Same process as above except use this script to run
```
./run_digital_ocean_perf.sh
```
and this to clean
```
./clean_digital_ocean_perf.sh
```

### How the JMeter tests are run in the Docker container:

JMeter Docker container in docker-compose.yml:
```
jmeter:
  image: hauptmedia/jmeter
  container_name: jmeter
  links:
    - web
  volumes:
    - ./app/jmeter:/opt/jmeter/tests
  command: bash -c "bin/jmeter -n -t tests/docker-local-perf-test.jmx -l tests/docker-local-perf-results.log"
```
We created a duplicate of the local-perf-test.jmx file with the HTTP Default settings configured to test on the lb container (haproxy).

### Performance Analysis

#### Testing Web Application Locally
It was fun to mess around with the number of threads (users), X, and ramp-up period (in secs), Y, to see how well our app could handle X requests in Y seconds. If Y < X, we received a higher error rate, especially in the create event and search event requests (probably due to the image content). To get rate of error of 0.00%, Y had to be roughly 3X. With Y being around 2X, there was about a 20.00% error rate.

#### Testing Web Application DigitalOcean
DigitalOcean had similar results except a larger ramp-up period was needed to reduce the error rate. For X users, a ramp-up period (Y) of 5X resulted in an error rate of 0.00%. When Y was about 4X, there was an error rate of roughly 15.00%. The major bottleneck again was in event search and create events. I think to improve performance so that our application can scale better, we would need to speed up how image content is delivered to the user.
